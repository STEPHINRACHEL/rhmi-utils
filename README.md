# Getting started

To get started using any of the provided analysis scripts and/or , simply clone the repo to your local machine
```
$ git clone https://github.com/integr8ly/rhmi-utils.git

Loading the i8-helper functions is as simple as sourcing ./bin/i8-helpers.sh
```
source </path/to>/rhmi-utils/bin/i8-helpers.sh
```
Its recommended to add this to your .bashrc so that the i8-* functions are always available in new terminals.

## Getting started - analyzing resource data

The analysis scripts are intended to be run against a resource snapshot file created by the get-resources.sh script (see below).  Once you have a resource snapshot file to use, you can use the provided scripts to extract specific pieces of data like so:

```
$ zcat ~/work/api.resources.xyz.json.gz | jq -f scripts/<scipt_name>.jq
```

## Creating a resource snapshot file from an OCP cluster

The get-resources script is designed to be runnable on any machine where oc is installed and logged in as a user with sufficient rights.

```
# Run locally from cloned repo
$ ~/repos/rhmi-utils/support/get-resources.sh
Data for api.xyz.openshift.com has been extracted to resources.api.xyz.openshift.com.20191210_193053Z.json.gz

# Run from a master node logged in as system:admin using the latest version without git, scp, etc.
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/rhmi-utils/master/support/get-resources.sh | bash
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  2989  100  2989    0     0   9479      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  9458
Data for internal.api.xyz.openshift.com has been extracted to resources.internal.api.xyz.openshift.com.20191210_220140Z.json.gz
```
Saving snapshots before and after making a change, performing an upgrade, etc., especially on production RHMI clusters, can be useful when troubleshooting issues, verifying state, and more.  Comparing output files from different clusters and/or different points in time can be useful.  Comparing two uncompressed output files as-is will typically show too many differences to be meaningful without reducing the data into something more targetted using one of the provided jq script files under scripts/ or creating your own.

### Extracting/Reducing data from a get-resources snapshot file
The most commonly used script is resources_by_namespace.jq which consolidates resource requests/limits from pod specs, storage usage from pvcs and actual cpu/mem usage from pod metrics into totals per namespace.

Using a script is as easy as
```
$ zcat </path/to/get-resources/snapshot/file>.json.gz | jq -f scripts/<scipt_name>.jq
[
  {
...
    "ns": "openshift-codeready",
    "cpu_real": 0.006,
    "mem_real": 379887616,
    "cpu_req": null,
    "mem_req": 1073741824,
    "cpu_lim": null,
    "mem_lim": 2147483648,
    "storage": 1073741824
  },
...
  {
    "ns": "openshift-enmasse",
    "cpu_real": 1.8840000000000001,
    "mem_real": 22897795072,
    "cpu_req": null,
    "mem_req": 72061654016,
    "cpu_lim": null,
    "mem_lim": 72330089472,
    "storage": 28991029248
...
  }
]
```

#### Extracting RHMI cluster resource data and container resource usage
**Note:** Ensure you already have a resource snapshot file

1. Run `zcat </path/to/get-resources/snapshot/file>.json.gz | jq -f ./scripts/rhmi_resources_by_container_pretty_csv.jq -r > containerresources.csv`
2. Run `zcat </path/to/get-resources/snapshot/file>.json.gz | jq -f ./scripts/resources_by_namespace_csv.jq -r > namespaceresources.csv`
3. Open https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U_Xigy6ffsgv6ifgDNsJPIuv8NS_kEkb6muc6dZWd-0 or another Google Sheet
4. Import the above csv files into individual tabs
5. *Manual Step:* Namespace sheet: Copy the Cluster totals and RHMI totals rows from the above spreadsheet
    * **Note:** Make sure the RHMI totals cells formula only target RHMI namespaces rows in the sheet.
6. *Manual Step:* Container sheet: Merge storage cells beside each other which have the same workload name and the same storage value
7. Colour code the rows using `Format > Alternating Colours` in Google Sheets


### Creating custom scripts
Its highly recommended to use one of the existing core scripts as a starting point and adapting it for your needs instead of starting from scratch.  While jq is very powerful, its easy to make a mistake and end up with a cartision product between two sets of data when you think you're getting a one-to-one or one-to-many (especially when you're working with such a large amount of input with varying schemas).

**PRO TIP:** If you find yourself tempted to pipe your output thru a unique filter to get rid of duplicate rows that you didn't expect, theres a good chance that you're dealing with an accidental cartision product.

The resources_by_namespace.jq script is a great starting point to use as it demonstrates several techniques:
- using common functions from the i8-helpers module for jq (/lib/jq/i8-helpers.jq)
- breaking up logic into functions
- joining pieces of data from multiple query results
- reshaping data with different schemas
- using normalizeResources/mem_to_bytes from the i8-helpers module to convert memory values from base 2 and 10 units into bytes so that they can be aggregated
The totals from resources_by_namespace are intentionally left raw/unformatted so that the output can be piped into another jq script or other external tools to do additional calculations.

The resources_by_namespace_pretty_csv.jq script includes the same base logic from resources_by_namespace.js; however, its focus is to demonstrate how to turn the raw numbers into human-friendly form using prettyBytes from the i8-helpers module.  When using this script, you'll likely want to include -r (--raw-output) to avoid the double escaping/quotes.

Another way to get machine readable version similar to the output above by piping the output of resources_by_namespace.jq into a custom jq query from the command line is:
```
$ zcat ~/repos/rhmi-utils/samples/xyz.json.gz | jq -f scripts/resources_by_namespace.jq | jq '(.[0] | to_entries | map(.key)), (.[] | [.[]]) | @csv' -r
"ns","cpu_real","mem_real","cpu_req","mem_req","cpu_lim","mem_lim","storage"
